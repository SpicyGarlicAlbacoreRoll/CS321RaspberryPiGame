Welcome! This is the group project repo for our CS321 Operating Systems course,

The intent of the project is to make a simple game for the Raspberry Pi that takes GPIO pins for input.

The actual content of this game is yet to be determined, but we hope to make it an
interesting experience.

Given the very specific nature of this game's inputs, we can't confirm that this will work for any particular setup
besides our own.
